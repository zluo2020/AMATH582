The accuracy of In-sample training stays 100 percent and out-of-sample accuracy below 50 percent which indicates the model is not working correctly. The SVD calculation for the dataset is so time-consuming that I didn't manage to finish the debuging process. Although I did find that the preprocessing works fine for imageDataStore built-in machine learaning approach, I could not provide a presentable result for my approach. I'll update the test results as soon as I fix it.
